<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>
  I built this portfolio on CodePen using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  
  I created this project independently but frequently used ChatGPT to accelerate development and learn new topics. 
  
  I also followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytl6TrroGis) Web Dev Simplified YouTube tutorial to enable the Scroll Snap functionality.

  I used [ChartsCSS](https://github.com/ChartsCSS/charts.css) to create the charts in the About Section. 

  You can check out the CodePen for this project [here](https://codepen.io/piers-kirk/pen/oNrbvNo).

  You can check out the deployed website [here](https://piers-kirk.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/#section-home). I used GitHub Pages to deploy the site. 

  Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio!

<h3>Future Tasks:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If the user keeps scrolling while on the first or last sections, the application doesn't properly snap back to a valid section.</li>
  <li>Multiple errors are being logged in the console. These need to be resolved.</li>
</ul>
